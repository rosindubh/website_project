      My journey into this world of information technology started with an electronics kit made by Philips in the 
      1960s that I received as a Christmas present from my mother. To this day I don’t know what made her buy it 
      for me. I always liked taking things to pieces, often unable to put them back together, but the desire to 
      know what was going on inside was too much for an inquisitive child.
      </pre>
   
      <pre>
      The kit itself allowed you to build numerous circuits, no soldering involved, radios, light activated alarms, 
      sound activated alarms it amazed me how so many things could be made with one circuit board and a few components. 
      However what I didn’t realise at that tender age was the circuits that now control our very lives lay hidden in 
      the final pages of that instruction manual.

      And gates, Or gates, Not gates, Nor, Nand Exclusive-Or what did these words mean? I had no one to explain it to 
      me my father was a plumber, “Gates lad, gates are to keep cows in fields, now go and tidy your room”,  I lived 
      in a world very different to the one we inhabit today. If you wanted to learn about a subject you needed something 
      called a library card. Do people still have those things?​

      Starting in the early 1980s with the first desktop / home computers, I myself started with a computer with 
      only 2k of memory and a 1Mhz processor (6502), laughable by today’s standards,  information technology has 
      played an incredible part in global business. Companies rely on IT for fast communications, data processing, 
      market research to name a few. In our modern and fast changing world it’s almost impossible to succeed  without.

      But it strikes me as somewhat odd how it all came together. Babbage and his analytical engine, Boole and his 
      parlour games, the genius of Alan Turing, numbers that go from zero to one, Grace Hopper who invented one of 
      the first linkers , Ada Lovelace credited with writing the first computer program and not forgetting the three 
      wise men (Bardeen, Brattain and Shockley) the inventors of the transistor itself. I know it's not a full list, 
      I'm sorry if I left your hero out. 
      </pre>

      <pre>
      But when I think of those transistors in my electronics kit, how could I ever have imagined billions of them on 
      a chip. Billions so small they are now standing them upright to get even more on that chip, and we're talking in 
      nano meters here. I marvel as I watch my 5 year old granddaughter play on her iPad oblivious to what's really 
      going on inside.

      My introduction to computers started in 1980 with the Acorn Atom, which I got in kit form and built myself 
      (I do love a challenge) made by Acorn in Cambridge, the company which was to invent the ARM processor, and 
      lets face it where would we be without that? There's almost certainly one in your mobile phone, and there 
      are more ARM chips on the planet than there are human arms, that's a staggering figure if you take a moment 
      to think about it. 
      </pre>

      <pre>
      So in the 50 odd years since my journey began the exponential advancement of technology has given us 
      unimaginable potential and there is no sign of that advancement stopping any time soon, quantam computers 
      anyone? IT is here to stay and if your not on board I suggest you hop on now because this bus ain't slowing 
      down for anyone.

      Now my main skills are in printing or to be more specific digital printing. I was colour specialist for 
      Canon Uk Ltd up until 2002. I joined in 1985 when photocopiers as they were then were analoge. Ahh a much 
      simpler time, there was no internet, well not to talk about there was ARPANET, but the world of business was 
      much slower, people were prepared to wait up to a point. 
      </pre>

      <pre>
      Then in the early 1990s Canon launched the CLC1 colour copier onto the world. This was a digital scanner with 
      what was really just a photocopier body bolted on under it. The Bank of England purchased one of them to design 
      their new £5 note, the idea being that they would colour the new note using all the colours that the CLC1 couldn't 
      produce very well. This was to combat fraud with people copying the note and passing it off as real. And it would 
      have worked but unfortunatly by the time they launched the new note Canon had launched the CLC500. A vastly superior 
      machine and well able to reproduce the new £5 note good enough to fool most people . Ces't la vie best laid plans of 
      mice and men". But there we have it again technology moving at a pace and we are trying to keep up.

      The success of every business today relies on choosing the right technology and a future vision in order to be successful. 
      Sun Microsystems the creators of Java (the first technology to make something happen on a web page demonstrated at Ted 85) 
      were to discover this. Their premises is now occupied by one of the largest companies on the planet (Facebook). Mr Zuckerberg 
      didn’t remove their sign though, he instead spun it 180 degrees and put Facebook on the front so when his staff leave the 
      office each day they are reminded how the mighty can fall. I’ll let you read about that yourself.

      Now coding is I beleive is one of the most important skills that should be taught to our children in the world today, and it 
      all began with FORTRAN (Formula Translation). Before this coding was low level hand to hand combat (machine code)  if you 
      wanted to talk to the computer it was on their terms. Nuclear power, space exploration it all happend in the 2nd half of the 
      20th century and that's because we learned how to talk to the machines. 
      </pre>

      <pre>
      We developed a language that with the use of something called a compier could translate the progarm, written in a very thinly 
      veiled form of English,  into machine code that the computer could understand. Invented by John Backus for IBM in 1954 .
      But and it's a big but, you have to be careful when talking to machines, as was seen in 1962 with the launch of the Mariner 1 
      space probe. FORTRAN was used in the guidance system, and 294.5 seconds after launch it was given a destructive abort, as the 
      rocket responded improperly to commands from the guidance system, and was ordered to self destruct, in what Auther C Clarke 
      called the most expensive hypen in history. 
      135 million dollars expensive. But that didn't mean FORTRAN was abandoned it's still around today, if you want to be an 
      astronamer your going to have to learn FORTRAN.
      </pre>

      <pre>
      So are we teaching it to our children? Well Eben Upton of the Rasperry Pi Foundation didn't beleive so which is why he came 
      up the Raspberry Pi. 
      It was never his intention to sell millions of them, that was Rory Cellan-Jones the BBC’s technology correspondents fault 
      for showing it to the world. It was to be used as a tool to test his students. They would be given one and he was looking 
      to see who came up with the most innovative ideas of using this little device. However it seemed that his undergraduate 
      students wern't up to the task. They had learnt a little PHP maybe and it was taking around 2 years to get them up to the 
      level he was expecting them to be at when they joined.
