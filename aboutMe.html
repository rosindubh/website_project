        <div class="box box1">My journey into this world of information technology started with an electronics kit made by Philips in the 1960s 
that I received as a Christmas present from my mother. To this day I don’t know what made her buy it for me. 
I always liked taking things to pieces, often unable to put them back together, but the desire to know what was 
going on inside was too much for an inquisitive child.
The kit itself allowed you to build numerous circuits, no soldering involved, radios, light activated alarms, 
sound activated alarms it amazed me how so many things could be made with one circuit board and a few components. 
However what I didn’t realise at that tender age was the circuits that now control our very lives lay hidden in 
the final pages of that instruction manual.
And gates, Or gates, Not gates, Nor, Nand Exclusive-Or what did these words mean? I had no one to explain it to 
me my father was a plumber, “Gates lad, gates are to keep cows in fields, now go and tidy your room”,  I lived in 
a world very different to the one we inhabit today. If you wanted to learn about a subject you needed something 
called a library card. Do people still have those things?​ Starting in the early 1980s with the first desktop / home computers, I myself started with a computer with only 2k 
of memory and a 1Mhz processor (6502), laughable by today’s standards,  information technology has played an 
incredible part in global business. Companies rely on IT for fast communications, data processing, market research 
to name a few. In our modern and fast changing world it’s almost impossible to succeed  without. 
But it strikes me as somewhat odd how it all came together. Babbage and his analytical engine, Boole and his parlour games, 
the genius of Alan Turing, numbers that go from zero to one, Grace Hopper who invented one of the first linkers , 
Ada Lovelace credited with writing the first computer program and not forgetting the three wise men (Bardeen, Brattain and Shockley) 
the inventors of the transistor itself. I know it's not a full list, I'm sorry if I left your hero out. But when I think of those 
transistors in my electronics kit, how could I ever have imagined billions of them on a chip. Billions so small they are now 
standing them upright to get even more on that chip, and we're talking in nano meters here. I marvel as I watch my 5 year old 
granddaughter play on her iPad oblivious to what's really going on inside.

        <div class="box box2">My introduction to computers started in 1980 with the Acorn Atom, which I got in kit form and built myself (I do love a challenge) 
made by Acorn in Cambridge, the company which was to invent the ARM processor, and lets face it where would we be without that? 
There's almost certainly one in your mobile phone, and there are more ARM chips on the planet than there are human arms, that's a 
staggering figure if you take a moment to think about it. So in the 50 odd years since my journey began the exponential advancement 
of technology has given us unimaginable potential and there is no sign of that advancement stopping any time soon, quantam computers 
anyone? IT is here to stay and if your not on board I suggest you hop on now because this bus ain't slowing down for anyone. Now my main skills are in printing or to be more specific digital printing. I was colour specialist for Canon Uk Ltd up until 2002. 
I joined in 1985 when photocopiers as they were then were analoge. Ahh a much simpler time, there was no internet, well not to talk 
about there was ARPANET, but the world of business was much slower, people were prepared to wait up to a point. Then in the early 
1990s Canon launched the CLC1 colour copier onto the world. This was a digital scanner with what was really just a photocopier body 
bolted on under it. The Bank of England purchased one of them to design their new £5 note, the idea being that they would colour 
the new note using all the colours that the CLC1 couldn't produce very well. This was to combat fraud with people copying the note 
and passing it off as real. And it would have worked but unfortunatly by the time they launched the new note Canon had launched the 
CLC500. A vastly superior machine and well able to reproduce the new £5 note good enough to fool most people . Ces't la vie "best 
laid plans of mice and men". But there we have it again technology moving at a pace and we are trying to keep up.

        <div class="box box3">The success of every business today relies on choosing the right technology and a future vision in order to be successful. 
Sun Microsystems the creators of Java (the first technology to make something happen on a web page demonstrated at Ted 85) 
were to discover this. Their premises is now occupied by one of the largest companies on the planet (Facebook). Mr Zuckerberg 
didn’t remove their sign though, he instead spun it 180 degrees and put Facebook on the front so when his staff leave the 
office each day they are reminded how the mighty can fall. I’ll let you read about that yourself.

Now coding is I beleive is one of the most important skills that should be taught to our children in the world today, and it all 
began with FORTRAN (Formula Translation). Before this coding was low level hand to hand combat (machine code)  if you wanted to talk 
to the computer it was on their terms. Nuclear power, space exploration it all happend in the 2nd half of the 20th century and 
that's because we learned how to talk to the machines. We developed a language that with the use of something called a compier 
could translate the progarm, written in a very thinly veiled form of English,  into machine code that the computer could understand. 
Invented by John Backus for IBM in 1954 .
But and it's a big but, you have to be careful when talking to machines, as was seen in 1962 with the launch of the Mariner 1 space probe. 
FORTRAN was used in the guidance system, and 294.5 seconds after launch it was given a destructive abort, as the rocket responded improperly 
to commands from the guidance system, and was ordered to self destruct, in what Auther C Clarke called the most expensive hypen in history. 
135 million dollars expensive. But that didn't mean FORTRAN was abandoned it's still around today, if you want to be an astronamer your 
going to have to learn FORTRAN.

So are we teaching it to our children? Well Eben Upton of the Rasperry Pi Foundation didn't beleive so which is why he came up the 
Raspberry Pi. 
It was never his intention to sell millions of them, that was Rory Cellan-Jones the BBC’s technology correspondents 
fault for showing it to the world. It was to be used as a tool to test his students. They would be given one and he was looking to 
see who came up with the most innovative ideas of using this little device. However it seemed that his undergraduate students wern't 
up to the task. They had learnt a little PHP maybe and it was taking around 2 years to get them up to the level he was expecting them 
to be at when they joined.
What strikes me as bewildering is 8 years after the launch of this little device we don't seem that much further forward from what I 
have witnessed in my industry. I meet young people in IT departments of some very large companies NHS, major banks, I won't name 
and shame, massive solicitor companies in Manchester, and these guys when I speak to them can't even get a printer to print, or 
an MFD (Multi Function Device) to scan to a folder or scan to email. It's always "your printer won't print". So I take it offline 
connect it to my laptop peer to peer and hey presto it does print and scan and email "the problem lies within your network pal."
Now they play the game, because they are so big they don't buy the IT support part of the contract when they lease the machines, 
they may have 400 plus machines in offices nationwide, and they will threaten to cancel their contract if I don't sort the problem, and I've 
worked for several large print sector companies, and they always give in. So my company had to spend a fortune getting me trained 
on the TCP/IP  suite of protocals and the seven layer model, specifically SMTP  and FTP in order for me to fault find their networks 
for free. Most of these guys don't even know how to PING a device and turn a whiter shade of pale at the sight of a 
command line interface (CLI).
